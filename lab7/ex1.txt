DB Design 


Book{_id:, ISBN: ,
author: ,
tags: ["Computer Science","JavaScript"]
,
 borrowings:[
{
student:{_id: , name: , phone: , email:},
BorrowDate: ,

DueDate:
},
{
student:{_id: , name: , phone: , email:},
BorrowDate: ,

DueDate:
}
]
}

	


I designed the database this way because I felt list of borrowings with the borrower can be included directly in each book.
